<h3>Apple</h3>
<p>
The MacBook was a brand of notebook computers manufactured by Apple Inc.
from May 2006 to February 2012, and relaunched in 2015.
It replaced the iBook series and 12-inch PowerBook series of notebooks as a part of the Apple-Intel transition from PowerPC. 
Positioned as the low end of the MacBook family, below the premium ultra-portable MacBook Air and the powerful MacBook Pro,the MacBook was aimed at the consumer and education markets.
It was the best-selling Macintosh ever. For five months in 2008, it was the best-selling laptop of any brand in US retail stores.
Collectively, the MacBook brand is the "world's top-selling line of premium laptops."
There have been four separate designs of the MacBook.
 The original model used a combination of polycarbonate and fiberglass casing which was modeled after the iBook G4.
 The second type was introduced in October 2008 alongside the 15-inch MacBook Pro; the MacBook shared the more expensive laptop's unibody aluminum casing, but omitted FireWire, which hurt sales.
[not in citation given] A third design, introduced in late 2009, had a polycarbonate unibody casing and no FireWire ports.

<h3>Dell</h3>
<p>
 Dell uses cookies and similar technologies to enhance your experience and customise content for you by understanding how you use our site.
By using our website without changing your cookie settings, you agree to our cookie policy.
To disable cookies, please use our cookie too.
Dell sold personal computers (PCs), servers, data storage devices, network switches, software, computer peripherals, 
HDTVs, cameras, printers, MP3 players, and electronics built by other manufacturers.
The company was well known for its innovations in supply 
chain management and electronic commerce, particularly its direct-sales model and its "build-to-order" or 
"configure to order" approach to manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications.
Dell was a pure hardware vendor for much of its existence, 
but with the acquisition in 2009 of Perot Systems, Dell entered the market for IT services.
The company has since made additional acquisitions in storage and networking systems,
with the aim of expanding their portfolio from offering computers only to delivering complete solutions for enterprise customers
